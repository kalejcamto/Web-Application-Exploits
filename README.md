# Web-Application-Exploits (XSS attack)
Web Application Exploits CySA certification prep lab




DVWA is a free, open-source application that was specifically designed with numerous web vulnerabilities to provide an infrastructure for security professionals to test and improve their Cyber Security skills in a secure legal infrastructure.

In this exercise, the DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) will be used to identify web application vulnerabilities and how these vulnerabilities can be exploited by an unauthorized malicious attacker.

I will be using virtual machines: -
(Kali Linux 2019 - Linux Kali)
(Windows 10 - Domain Member Workstation)


### first phase - Verify that the DVWA is running
The DVWA is a free, open-source application that can be used by Cybersecurity professionals to practice and enhance their cybersecurity skillset in a secure legal infrastructure.

In this task, the DVWA will be started which will be needed in the following tasks to conduct web application exploits.

Click Start and select XAMPP Control Panel. The XAMPP application is used to host an Apache web application on Windows and Linux operating systems. This application also configures the necessary MySQL database for the installation. In the infrastructure, the application has already been configured to run the DVWA. In the XAMPP Control Panel in the Actions I select Start APACHE and Start MySQL.
See image below:

Note: The Apache and MySQL services need to run for the DVWA to be accessible.
Note: After starting these services, it can be seen which ports are open for the DVWA to function. Port 80 and 443 are used for web application traffic on the network; port 80 uses the http protocol, and port 443 uses the https protocol. The https protocol is more secure as it encrypts the network, where the http protocol does not encrypt the traffic.

I minimized this window and continued with the following task.


###  Access Admin Login at DVWA WIN10 server

In the Microsoft Edge browser, navigate to the following URL: http://192.168.0.4/dvwa
![image](https://github.com/kalejcamto/Web-Application-Exploits/assets/101201140/22e95685-0778-47e3-95fd-194436dea4c0)


Note: After successful login with admin credentials, the different types of Web application exploits are shown.


### Connect to Kali Linux and Access Admin Login at DVWA 

In the left-hand side menu bar, select Firefox ESR and browse to the following URL http://192.168.0.4/dvwa
![image](https://github.com/kalejcamto/Web-Application-Exploits/assets/101201140/30388458-3341-406d-b7a7-4296bc3cc4b2)

#### Note: The DVWA was accessed remotely from PLABKALI01 using the Firefox ESR web browser. By using Kali Linux, specific web application vulnerabilities can be exploited.

# Second phase: Perform a Cross-site scripting attack (XSS)
A Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack is performed by injecting a malicious script into a vulnerable web application.

By injecting the malicious script, it will allow an attacker to mislead a different user’s web browser to accept the malicious code as legitimate, which will give the attacker access to information stored by the web browser.

The two different forms of Cross-site scripting attacks are stored and reflected attack types.

A stored Cross-site scripting attack as the name suggests stores the malicious script in the vulnerable website where with a reflected attack, the script is injected through other means, for example, an email or through search results in a web browser.
##### In this task, a Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack will be conducted on the DVWA.

I ensured that Apache and MySQL are still running and select the Microsoft Edge Browser from the taskbar.

Note: After logging in, the user that has logged in with the security level for the application is displayed at the bottom of the page. As can be seen, the Security level is set to impossible. This security level needs to be changed to ensure the XSS attack can be conducted.

### On the DVWA Security page, change the security level to Low from the options available in the dropdown menu.

Click Submit. Note: By changing the security level DVWA to low, it makes the application vulnerable with no security measures in place. 
From the left-hand side pane, select XSS (Stored).

and I have to type this given text and click on sign Guestbook, so I do:

The next step is to create another message using HTML tags. HTML tags are used to test to see if the website will accept these specific tags, which will identify a possible vulnerability.

<b> tag will format the text to bold and the <i> tags will format the text into italic.

The Name field allows only ten characters.

Enter the following values on the Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) page:

![image](https://github.com/kalejcamto/Web-Application-Exploits/assets/101201140/647214ed-5073-4462-9529-479b93a3e5b9)

When I do it:

As can be seen from the output, the vulnerable website accepted the HTML tags. This can make it possible to inject malicious Javascript code into the webpage.

Let’s create another message.

I Entered the following values on the Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) page:
![image](https://github.com/kalejcamto/Web-Application-Exploits/assets/101201140/c558241d-4137-4894-be80-873972320554)


![image](https://github.com/kalejcamto/Web-Application-Exploits/assets/101201140/8f78d063-b2db-4a24-ac1c-83bf6d3343b8)

By entering Javascript, a pop-up message is generated, showing that the website is vulnerable to an XSS attack.

Alert: If a pop up message is not generated switch back to kali linux device. Open Firefox ESR and go to the following site: http//:192.168.0.4/dvwa
Login using the credentials from admin that I used before on the Kalilinux device.

####Note: The pop-up window displays the security level and the Session ID of the user. As this is a Stored Cross-site scripting attack every time a user signs the Guestbook, their SessionID will be displayed. These types of attacks can be prevented by ensuring the best coding practices when developing websites.
